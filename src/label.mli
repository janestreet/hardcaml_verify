(** Labels represent named variables. They contain a [uid] (unique identifier) which is
    constructed when the label is created. The name is not used for comparison.

    We need to represent vectors, even though the core variable type is a single bit. As
    such labels also refer to their bit position. The pair [(uid,bit_pos)] is used for
    comparison in order to distinguish labels.
